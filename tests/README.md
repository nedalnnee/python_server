The 'tests' directory is where we keep a few 
automated tests for the page server. Using shell commands.

These tests use [curl](https://curl.se/), a Unix utility
for fetching data from a server. It's like requesting a
URL with a browser, but without the browser. This allows
you to run more tests, more quickly, and often than we
could by hand. You should also do a little bit of manual
testing using a browser, just to be sure there isn't some
bug that affects interactive use but is not triggered by
these test scripts. 

To test:  You will need to be running your server in 
one shell/bash window, and running these tests in another
window (ideally on a different machine).
